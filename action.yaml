# Sends a build related notification message to a Microsoft Teams channel URI.
#
# Each sending user sending messages will need a Teams channel URI for each channel
# being targeted.  This URI identifies the user by name and optionally a profile image
# and also includes a secret that authenticates the operation.  You can obtain channel
# URIs by following:
#
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using
#
# Channel URIs are secrets and should be persisted to the 1Password account for the user
# and obtained at runtime via the noenFORGE deployment mechanisms.

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# ---------------------
# We're sending actionable cards using the Adaaptive Card message format:
