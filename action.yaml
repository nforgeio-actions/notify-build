# Sends a message to a Microsoft Teams channel URI.
#
# Each sending user sending messages will need a Teams channel URI for each channel
# being targeted.  This URI identifies the user by name and optionally a profile image
# and also includes a secret that authenticates the operation.  You can obtain channel
# URIs by following:
#
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using
#
# Channel URIs are secrets and should be persisted to the 1Password account for the user
# and obtained at runtime via the noenFORGE deployment mechanisms.
#
# NOTE: The nforgeio-actions/neon-environment action automatically loads the 
#       user-devops/TEAM_DEVOPS_CHANNEL[value] URI into the env.TEAM_DEVOPS_CHANNEL
#       variable, making this available for subsequent actions in a workflow.

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# ---------------------
# We're sending actionable cards using the Legacy Actionable Message format because the 
# new Adaptive Card format is not currently supported by Microsoft Teams:
#
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference
